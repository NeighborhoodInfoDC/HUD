** PROJECT:  DMPED - Affordable Housing Assessment 
**
** DESCRIPTION :  reads in comma delimited Consolidated Planning/Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) files 
**				  for Tables 1, 3, 8, 14b, 15c, 16 at the tract and state levels
**				These tables are special tabulations of the 2006-10 ACS 5 Year Estimates. This program 
**				  then merges all the data into a single dataset.  Data for DC only.
